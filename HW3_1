#Download or copy-and-paste the DNA sequence of the Anthrax SASP gene from the anthrax_sasp.nuc file in the course data-directory. 
#Treat the provided sequence as the sequence to be translated (no 5' UTR).â€¨Write a Python program to 
#print answers to the following questions:
#Does the SASP gene start with a Met codon?
#Does the SASP gene have a frame 1 Met codon? 
#How many nucleotides in the SASP gene?
#How many amino-acids in the SASP protein?
#What is the GC content (% G or C nucleotides) of the SASP gene?
#Test your program with other gene sequences.
