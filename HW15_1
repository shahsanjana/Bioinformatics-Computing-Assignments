#Rework the lecture, and your solutions (or mine) from the homework exercises #1 through #3, to make a MyDNAStuff module. 
#Put as many useful nucleotide functions as possible into the module...

#Rework the lecture, and your solutions (or mine) from homework exercises #4 and #5 to make the codon_table module with functions
specified in this lecture. 
#Demonstrate the use of these modules to translate an amino-acid sequence in all six-frames with just a few lines of code. 
#The final result should look similar to Slide 10. our program should handle DNA sequence with N’s in it.
